## Features

- **iSSR** supports native setState, Redux (thunk, sagas), Mobx, Apollo and other state management libraries
- TypeScript support
- Small size (5kb)
- No dependencies

## Getting Started

Modern JS applications are divided into 2 types:
- CSR - *Client-Side rendering*. The application will be displayed only after downloading and executing all the necessary JS code. Until then, the user will see a blank page. It degrades the UX and is bad for SEO.
- SSR - *Server-Side rendering*. The auxiliary server doesn't send a blank page, but a page with data. Thus, the user can immediately start working with the application, and search engine bots will index the page.

## SSR

Schematically, the SSR application looks like this:

![iSSR](https://www.rockpack.io/readme_assets/rockpack_ussr_1.png)

- SSR application consists of two sub-applications - frontend and backend with common logic.
- NodeJS app runs React app.
- **iSSR** handles all asynchronous operations.
- After receiving data from asynchronous operations, the React application is rendered.
- NodeJS application serves HTML to the user.

## Problems

One of the key problems with SSR applications are asynchronous operations. JS is an asynchronous language, all requests to the server, on which our application data depends, are asynchronous. They affect the state of the system - these are side effects. Since content availability is critical for search engines, we must handle this asynchronous behavior. The React Server Renderer is designed as a synchronous operation that steps through our React-DOM step by step and turns it into HTML.

The second problem is hydration. A process that allows us to associate the received HTML and the state of the application from the server with what will be built in the user's browser.

**iSSR** handles asynchronous operations and synchronizes state on the client.

## Motivation

React currently has many solutions for building SSR applications. The most popular solution is **Next.JS**. This is a great framework with many possibilities, iSSR cannot replace it. But, **Next.JS** requires rewriting your existing application completely. **Next.JS** is a framework, which means you have to use its approaches. **iSSR** is just a small library that handles side effects and synchronizes state.
- You can very quickly migrate your existing application to SSR using **iSSR** without major changes.
- You can use any build system.
- You can use any state management solution like Redux, Apollo, Mobx or native setState.
- You can use any other SSR libraries (for example @loadable, react-helmet, etc).

## Using

The simplest example of an SSR application using an asynchronous function via setState

### Example:

Here is a simple Todo List Application without SSR. It uses *jsonplaceholder* for mocking the data:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';

const getTodos = () => (
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
    .then(data => data.json())
);

const TodoList = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    getTodos()
      .then(todos => setTodos(todos))
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hi</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id} style={{ textDecoration: todo.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none' }}>{todo.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

render(
  <TodoList />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

It's very simple, when we open the application it will load the todo list data from the server and render it.

**Let's change this app to SSR:**

**Step 1**. Installation:

```sh
npm install @issr/core --save
npm install @issr/babel-plugin --save-dev
```

Basic webpack configuration for SSR:

```sh
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-react babel-loader webpack webpack-cli nodemon-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

*For this example we should install node-fetch because native **fetch** does not support **node.js**. Also, for the server we will use express, but you can use any module*

```sh
npm install node-fetch express --save
```

**Step 2**. Make *webpack.config.js* in the root of project

```js
const path = require('path');
const NodemonPlugin = require('nodemon-webpack-plugin');

const common = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.jsx$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: [
          {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
              presets: [
                '@babel/preset-react'
              ],
              plugins: [
                '@issr/babel-plugin'
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  resolve: {
    extensions: [
      '.js',
      '.jsx'
    ]
  }
}

module.exports = [
  {
    ...common,
    target: 'node',
    entry: './src/server.jsx',
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
      filename: 'index.js',
    },
    plugins: [
      new NodemonPlugin({
        watch: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
      })
    ]
  },
  {
    ...common,
    entry: './src/client.jsx',
    output: {
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, './public'),
      filename: 'index.js',
    }
  }
];
```

The main goal is to create 2 applications **client** and **server** with common logic.

**Step 3**. Let's separate the general logic from rendering. Let's create **App.jsx**, and take out the common part for both Frontend and Backend:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';
import { useSsrState, useSsrEffect } from '@issr/core';

const getTodos = () => (
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos')
    .then(data => data.json())
);

export const App = () => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useSsrState([]);

  useSsrEffect(async () => {
    const todos = await getTodos()
    setTodos(todos);
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hi</h1>
      <ul>
        {todos.map(todo => (
          <li key={todo.id} style={{ textDecoration: todo.completed ? 'line-through' : 'none' }}>{todo.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this code, *getTodos* is an asynchronous operation that makes call to the *jsonplaceholder* server and gets the todo list data.

 - *useSsrState* is analogue of useState only with SSR support

 - *useSsrEffect* is analogue useEffect (() => {}, []); for SSR. It works with any async logic.

**Step 4**. **client.jsx** should contain part of the application for Frontend

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { hydrate } from 'react-dom';
import createSsr from '@issr/core';
import { App } from './App';

const SSR = createSsr(window.SSR_DATA);

hydrate(
  <SSR>
    <App />
  </SSR>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The code:

```js
const SSR = createSsr(window.SSR_DATA);
```

Associates the state executed on the server with the application on the client side. For correct work *useSsrState* on the client

**Step 5**. **server.jsx** should contain the logic of the NodeJS application, it is convenient to use the koa/express framework or similar for this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import express from 'express';
import { serverRender } from '@issr/core';
import serialize from 'serialize-javascript';
import { App } from './App';

const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.get('/*', async (req, res) => {
  const { html, state } = await serverRender(() => <App />);

  res.send(`
  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
    <script>
      window.SSR_DATA = ${serialize(state, { isJSON: true })}
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root">${html}</div>
    <script src="/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
`);
});

app.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 4000!');
});
```

There are 2 important points in this code:

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
```

The server should serve the folder where frontend part of application is built.

```html
<script>
  window.SSR_DATA = ${serialize(state, { isJSON: true })}
</script>
```

This code saves the executed state on the server to use it on the client side later .

**Step 6**
The final step is webpack's scripts for development mode and building. Add to your **package.json**:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack -w",
  "build": "webpack"
},
```
